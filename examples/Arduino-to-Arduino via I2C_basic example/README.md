# Arduino-to-Arduino via I2C 

This example explores I2C communication between two Arduino MEGA boards, based on [this example](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/MasterWriter) by [Nicholas Zambetti](http://www.zambetti.com)

## Connections
- Connect SDA (pin20) to SDA, SCL (pin21) to SCL and GND to GND. 
- Connect 5V on slave to VIN on master, or power the master externally (not connected to the computer)
- Connect the slave via USB to your computer and open serial moniter at 9600 baud.
